🚀 How to Execute
Connect to Oracle

sqlplus username/password@database
Run the SQL files in order:

@sql/setup.sql      -- Create schema and insert sample data  
@sql/queries.sql    -- Run basic and advanced queries  
@sql/plsql.sql      -- Create procedures, triggers, functions  
@sql/admin.sql      -- Set roles, privileges, indexes  
🧬 Database Schema
Tables:
BOOKS: Book details (book_id, title, author, ISBN, copies, etc.)
MEMBERS: Member info (member_id, name, contact, type, etc.)
TRANSACTIONS: Borrow/return logs with fine status
✅ Requirements Covered
Requirement	Implemented
📚 20 Books	✅
👨‍🎓 15 Members	✅
🔁 25 Transactions	✅
📥 Overdue Queries	✅
📈 Top Borrowed Stats	✅
⚙️ PL/SQL Procedures	✅
🧾 Fine Calculation	✅
🔐 User Access Control	✅
⚡ Performance Indexing	✅
📌 PL/SQL Components
ISSUE_BOOK (member_id, book_id) → Validates and processes a new borrowing request

CALCULATE_FINE (transaction_id) → Returns fine based on overdue days (₹5/day)

UPDATE_AVAILABLE_COPIES trigger → Updates available_copies automatically on returns

👥 User Roles
Role	Access Level
librarian	Full access to all operations
student_user	Read-only access to BOOKS table
📬 Final Notes
This project represents a real-world simulation of managing a university library system, using Oracle DB tools and best practices in SQL and PL/SQL. It covers the full lifecycle from schema design to analytics and automation.
